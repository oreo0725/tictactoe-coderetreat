This is a tic-tac-toe game implementation for practice purpose. (see http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Noughts_and_Crosses)

## Game rules
I believe everybody knows this game and played it in the past.

Here is a quick highlight of game rules for implementation.

1. 2 players to start the game
1. The first player uses **O** symbol to mark his move
1. Players take turn to move, each turn only can put 1 step on the game pad
1. Cannot replace the symbol that already placed by an opponent.
1. After someone won the game, game is over, no body can make move anymore
